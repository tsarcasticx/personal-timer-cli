# Timer-cli
A timer program written in Rust

## Why?
Because I forget the time when doing something very often. So, I manage my time by creating my personal timer.

## How?
This program actually runs scripts or commands, and maybe you have to install these programs to perfectly execute it:
- dunst
- mpv

Yes. Timer-cli runs on Linux
